Each team carries it's point total forward every episode.  Depending on their score for an episode, a team gets a set of choices::

Winning options: Steal a player from bottom score, add a player, get a secret weapon, steal a secret weapon, punish a loser

Winners pick:

 1. top score: any 3
 2. 2nd high: any 2
 3. 3rd: any one

Loses pick or receive: Lose a player, lose a weapon, inherit an encumberance (crappy coder, crappy codebase, crappy constraint like all code has to be in cobol)

Loses pick:

 1. any one
 2. any two
 3. any three


When a team 0 players, they are "krushed" and no longer in play.  Other teams divide the spoils among themselves in the Arena of Cannabalism.
